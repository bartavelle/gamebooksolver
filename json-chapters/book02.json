Its makers were of a race that men would now call gods. To release the power that it contains, only a Kai Lord may wield it. Should it be used in combat by anyone who is not a Kai Lord, its power will fade and be lost forever.\nWhen used in combat, the Sommerswerd will add 8 points to your COMBAT SKILL (10 points if you possess the Kai Discipline of Weaponskill with swords). It has the ability to absorb any magic that is used against its bearer, and it doubles the total of all ENDURANCE points lost by undead enemies (e.g. Helghast) in combat. It is the only weapon in all of Magnamund that can kill a Darklord, and for this reason the Darklords are bent on thwarting your quest.\nYou now realize you hold the only power in Magnamund that can save your people.

It is so strong and painful that you collapse to the ground. You lose 2 ENDURANCE points.\nYou are amazed to see the man jump to his feet, and then horrified to see the dreadful change that comes over him. The skin of his face appears to writhe and change colour, growing darker and shrinking as it decays on his skull. His eyes burn with a bright red glow and long fangs protrude from his bottom jaw. You choke with fear as you realize it is a Helghast, a nightmarish agent of the Darklords. It is attacking you with its powerful Mindforce. If you do not have the Kai Discipline of Mindshield, you will lose 2 ENDURANCE points for *every* round of combat that you fight with this creature. Normal weapons cannot harm it and it is immune to Mindblast. You can only wound it in combat with the Magical Spear. (The Magic Spear is a weapon-like Special Item. Remember that you only get a Weaponskill bonus in this fight against the Helghast if you have Weaponskill with Spear.)\nYou cannot evade this creature and you must fight it to the death.\nIf you win the combat, you can keep the Spear.

The <<Kalkarm>> is eventually freed and slowly it manoeuvres out of the tangle of wreckage. A wind begins to stir, filling its tattered sails and carrying away the smoke of battle. Lord Axim orders the Royal Arms of Durenor to be hoist aloft so that other ships can rally to the <<Kalkarm>>. For the first time since the battle began, you can now see the other Durenese ships.

One Crown apiece.\"\nLooking out of the window, it is pouring down with rain but you can just make out a wooden bridge and a log cabin in the distance. The driver halts the coach at the log cabin and an ugly creature appears at the doorway. It is a warty-skinned Szall, a harmless and cowardly breed of Giak. They have been natives of the Wildlands since the Age of the Black Moon, when thousands of their kind migrated from the Durncrag Mountains to avoid the tyranny of Vashna, the mightiest of the Darklords.\nThe Szall demands one Gold Crown from each passenger before the coach will be allowed to pass. The other passengers each place one Crown upon a small plate and hand it to you.\n",

You are given a silver token worth 1 Gold Crown, that can only be used in this gaming-house.

One that catches your eye is called \"Cartwheel\". At one end of a long table, an attractive young woman spins a black dish divided into ten sections marked 0-9. As the dish spins, she drops a small silver ball into it which eventually comes to rest in one of the numbered sections. Several merchants are seated around the table and they are betting heavily on the fall of the silver ball.\nTo play \"Cartwheel\", you must first decide the number you would like to bet on and just how many Gold Crowns you would like to stake. Make a note of these numbers and then pick a number from the Random Number Table. If you pick exactly the same number, you win 8 Gold Crowns for every 1 Gold Crown that you gamble. If the number you pick is immediately before or after the correct choice, you win 5 Gold Crowns for every 1 Gold Crown that you stake. (Note that 0 sits between 9 and 1 in Cartwheel.) There is a limit to how much you can win on this table: 40 Gold Crowns.\nYou may play as many rounds of \"Cartwheel\" as you wish until either you lose all your Gold Crowns, or you decide to pick up your winnings (maximum of 40 Gold Crowns).\n",

As you climb over the side of the ship, you are met by a tall man in a gold-braided uniform. His face is almost totally covered by a shock of bright red hair and a bright red beard.\n\"Haul anchor!\" he booms. The crew spring into action as if their very lives depended on it.\nThe captain ushers you below to his cabin where he pours two glasses of wanlo, a strong spirit. His face shows concern as you tell him what has happened.\n\"There is evil treachery at work and the enemy already has plans afoot to thwart your quest,\" he begins when you've told your tale. \"It seems that you have lost the element of surprise-and I have lost a courageous first mate. Let us only hope that the voyage to Durenor be swift and safe.\"\nYou leave him to go up on deck just in time to see the outline of Holmgard on the horizon. With mixed feelings of pride and apprehension, you descend the stairway to your cabin as the last spire of the capital disappears from view.\nPick a number from the Random Number Table.\n",

The Darklords' army with their evil engines of war surround the walls, and the flaming arcs of fireballs shooting through the air continually light the night sky as they rain down on the streets below. The people fight the fire as best they can, but they are hungry and exhausted and close to surrender. At first, as it enters the harbour, the fleet is mistaken for the enemy and cries of despair can be heard all along the quay. But as the first of the soldiers set foot in the city and unfurl the royal arms of Durenor, the news of your return spreads quickly. The cries of despair have changed to a chorus of cheers: \"The Kai Lord has returned.\"\nYou are standing at the top of the great watchtower, high above the main gate of the city, when the first light of dawn creeps slowly over the horizon. Thousand upon thousand of the black-clad enemy are massed around the city wall, huddled like beetles in the trenches that cover the plain. In the midst of this horde, a great red tent has been erected bearing the symbol of a broken skull. It is the mark of Zagarna, Lord of Kaag, a Darklord of Helgedad. His great ambition is the destruction of Holmgard; his fiercest desire to lead his army to victory over the House of Ulnar and claim Sommerlund for his own.\nBut victory is not to be his this day. Raising the Sommerswerd high above your head, a shaft of dawn sunlight catches upon the tip of the golden sword and a brilliant flash of blinding white flame runs the entire length of the blade. The power of the Sommerswerd electrifies you. Your senses reel and now your body reacts instinctively. You lower the Sommerswerd and point the blade towards the tent of Lord Zagarna. There is a mighty roar as the power of the sun-sword is unleashed in a searing white beam. The tent explodes and a brilliant fireball of white flame mushrooms skyward. A long and terrible cry rends the air. It is Lord Zagarna. The leader of the evil army is no more.\nGripped with fear and panic, the vast black army rise up and run in chaos from the city wall. The impossible has happened, their invincible master is slain. Again the Sommerswerd has returned to defeat them. The army and the allies of Durenor ride out of the city gates in pursuit of the panic-stricken enemy as they run blindly towards the Durncrag Mountains. The victory is yours. Holmgard is saved and the murder of the Kai has finally been avenged.\nBut for you, Lone Wolf, a life of high adventure has only just begun. A new challenge awaits you and the Sommerswerd in Book Three of the <<Lone Wolf>> series:\n<<The Caverns of Kalte>>\n",
